# 🚂 Smart Train Traffic Controller

**Railway Automation System for Delay Prediction & Intelligent Rerouting**

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Railway networks face significant challenges with train delays, causing disruptions that affect millions of passengers daily. Traditional traffic control systems lack predictive capabilities and real-time optimization, leading to cascading delays and inefficient resource utilization.

## 💡 Solution

Smart Train Traffic Controller is an AI-powered microservices-based system that:

- **Predicts train delays** using machine learning models trained on historical data and real-time conditions
- **Suggests optimal rerouting** strategies to minimize disruption
- **Provides a live dispatcher dashboard** for real-time decision making
- **Automates traffic control** with intelligent algorithms
