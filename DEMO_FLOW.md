3. **Generate Rerouting Plan**
- Click "🚀 Generate Rerouting Plan"
- Wait for computation (1-2 seconds)

4. **Review AI Recommendations**

**a) Recommended Action**

⚠️ REROUTE - Take alternative path


**b) Route Optimization**
🗺️ Suggested Route:
Mumbai → Panvel → Lonavala → Pune


**c) Alternative Trains**
🚂 ALT5432
⏰ Departure: 18:15
💺 Available Seats: 150
🛤️ Route: Mumbai → Pune (Direct)

🚂 ALT7891
⏰ Departure: 18:45
💺 Available Seats: 120
🛤️ Route: Mumbai → Pune (Direct)


**d) Recovery Metrics**
Recovery Time: 15 minutes
Confidence Score: 85%


5. **Dispatcher Decision**
- Demonstrate three action buttons:
  - ✅ Accept Reroute (green)
  - ❌ Reject Reroute (red)
  - ⏸️ Hold for Review (yellow)
- Click "✅ Accept Reroute"
- Show success message

### Key Points to Highlight
- ✅ Graph-based route optimization
- ✅ Alternative train suggestions
- ✅ Recovery time estimation
- ✅ Human-in-the-loop (dispatcher approval)
- ✅ Confidence scoring

## 📤 Scenario 4: Schedule Upload (2 minutes)

### Objective
Bulk train schedule management.

### Steps

1. **Switch to Upload Mode**
- Sidebar → Select "Upload Schedule"

2. **Upload CSV**
- Click "Browse files"
- Upload provided sample_data.csv
- Show success message: "✅ Uploaded 50 train records"

3. **Preview Data**
- Display first 10 rows
- Show column structure

4. **Analysis (Future Feature)**
- Click "📊 Analyze Schedule"
- Mention upcoming features

## 🎤 Demo Script

### Opening (30 sec)
"Smart Train Traffic Controller is an AI-powered railway automation system that predicts delays and optimizes rerouting in real-time, built entirely with open-source tools and Docker."

### Dashboard (1 min)
"Here we see 50 active trains, with 10 currently delayed. The red indicators show problem areas, and dispatchers can filter by station or status."

### Prediction (2 min)
"Let's predict delays for Train TR0025 departing Mumbai at 5:30 PM. Given rain and peak hours, our model predicts 70% delay probability with HIGH risk."

### Rerouting (3 min)
"Train TR0041 is delayed 45 minutes. Our AI suggests an alternative route via Panvel, recommends 3 backup trains, and estimates 15-minute recovery. The dispatcher can accept or reject."

### Closing (30 sec)
"This system reduces delays, optimizes resources, and provides data-driven insights—all deployable in 24 hours with just Docker."
